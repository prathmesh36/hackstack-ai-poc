General elections were held in India from 19 April to 1 June 2024 in seven phases, to elect all 543 members of the Lok Sabha.[a] Votes were counted and the result was declared on 4 June to form the 18th Lok Sabha.[3][4] Out of total 543 seats, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured majority with 293 seats, which included the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) 240 seats [5], while the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) got 234 seats, including the Congress party's 99 seats.[6] On 9 June 2024, Narendra Modi was sworn in as Prime Minister, being the leader of the NDA alliance, though his BJP lost its singular majority.[7]

This was the largest-ever Indian election, surpassing the previous election, and lasted 44 days, second only to the 1951–52 Indian general election. More than 968 million people out of a population of 1.4 billion people were eligible to vote, equivalent to 70 percent of the total population.[8][9][10] 642 million voters participated in the election and 312 million of them were women, making it the highest ever participation by women voters.[11][12] The legislative assembly elections in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha, and Sikkim were held simultaneously with the general election, along with the by-elections for 25 constituencies in 12 legislative assemblies.

Incumbent prime minister Narendra Modi, who completed a second term, ran for a third consecutive term after his BJP had enjoyed an absolute majority—a minimum of 272 seats—in the 2019 and 2014 elections. The primary opposition was the INDIA coalition formed by the Congress party and many regional parties in 2023. The election was criticised for lack of action on hate speeches by Modi's BJP,[13] reported Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) malfunctioning,[14][15] and suppression of political opponents of the BJP.[16]

Opinion surveys of mainstream media outlets projected a decisive victory for the BJP and its NDA coalition. However, the BJP won 240 seats, down from the 303 seats it had secured in 2019, and lost its singular majority in the Lok Sabha, whereas the overall NDA secured 293 of the house's 543 seats.[5] The INDIA coalition outperformed expectations, securing 234 seats, 99 of which were won by the Congress, garnering the party the Official Opposition status for the first time in 10 years.[6][17][18] Seven independents and ten candidates from non-aligned parties also won seats in the Lok Sabha.[19][20][21] On 7 June 2024, Modi confirmed the support of 293 MPs to Droupadi Murmu, the president of India.[22] This marked Modi's third term as prime minister and his first time heading a coalition government,[23] with the Telugu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh and Janata Dal (United) of Bihar emerging as two main allies.[24][25][26]
